                My most recent experience was as a gameplay programmer at AvtrixGames, where I designed and developed advanced game systems with realistic ballistics, environmental interaction, lighting effects, and artificial intelligence. I optimized code performance and scalability and collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to create immersive experiences. My goal is to contribute my experience and creativity to ambitious and challenging projects that innovate in the world of game development.
